All directories are small snippets solving dedicated problems (partly
from past Google code jams, Topcoder, etc). Some of them also implement
particular algorithms to study them.

This is a simple learning module for myself to study various algorithms.
Because I figured that I suck at algorithm analysis and should be able
to come up with better solutions for problems, I'm studying problems and
algorithms.
They might be useful for anyone else or for me to simply look back how I
solved a particular problem.
